# Suspicious Transactions

### Is there any evidence to suggest that a credit card has been hacked? Explain your rationale.

There seems to be a lot of transactions per cardholder which are less than $2. That would suggest that some of the information might be comprised but more investigations need to be done before it can be properly concluded whether or not credit cards are hacked.

### Take your investigation a step futher by considering the time period in which potentially fraudulent transactions are made.

* Do you see any anomalous transactions that could be fraudulent?
There is still no conclusive evidence that any of the transactions are fraudulent.

* Is there a higher number of fraudulent transactions made during this time frame versus the rest of the day?
There are zero transactions which are less than $2 made during this time as compared to 353 transactions made outside 7 AM and 9 AM. This indicates more fraudulent transactions occur before 7 AM and after 9 AM.
